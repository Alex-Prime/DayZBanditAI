DZAI - DayZ AI Addon (Current version: 0.06+0.07 Patch 2)
============


This new package is MP-compatible and works out of the box with any supported DayZ mission file. 

Currently supported and tested DayZ missions:
- Chernarus
- DayZ Epoch (Chernarus)

Currently supported (but untested) DayZ missions:
- Celle			(Pending testing)
- Namalsk		(Pending testing)
- Fallujah
- Isla Duala
- Lingor		(Note: DZAI is planned to support only Skaronator DayZ Lingor from version 0.08 onwards)
- Oring
- Panthera
- Takistan
- Taviana 2.0 	(Note: DZAI will no longer be updated for Taviana 2.0 after DayZ 1.7.7 is released)
- Utes
- Zargabad
- <b>Note</b>: DZAI version 0.03+ should work with any DayZ mission file. However for DayZ mods not listed above, no AI units will spawn from buildings and default DayZ loot tables will be used to generate AI loadouts. You will have to create and add your own configuration file to create new spawn points. AI may also be randomly spawned by modifying the DZAI_spawnRandom variable. 

Version 0.07 Patch 1&2 Update:

- 

Installation Instructions:
- Extract your mission .pbo file. (I recommend cpbo, which can be downloaded as part of the Arma Tools package: http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=411)
- Copy the entire DZAI folder into the extracted mission folder.
- Edit your init.sqf with a text editor.
- Add the line to your init.sqf file after DayZ's compiled functions: 

<code>call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "DZAI\init\dayz_ai_initialize.sqf";				//Load DayZ AI Bandit Module</code>

Example edit (Note: this block of code is easier to read in a text editor such as Notepad++):

<code>//Load in compiled functions
call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "\z\addons\dayz_code\init\variables.sqf";				//Initilize the Variables (IMPORTANT: Must happen very early)
progressLoadingScreen 0.1;
call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "\z\addons\dayz_code\init\publicEH.sqf";				//Initilize the publicVariable event handlers
progressLoadingScreen 0.2;
call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "\z\addons\dayz_code\medical\setup_functions_med.sqf";	//Functions used by CLIENT for medical
progressLoadingScreen 0.4;
call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "\z\addons\dayz_code\init\compiles.sqf";				//Compile regular functions
progressLoadingScreen 0.6;
call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "DZAI\init\dayz_ai_initialize.sqf";				//Load DayZ AI Bandit Module
progressLoadingScreen 1.0;</code>

- Optional: Edit dayz_ai_variables.sqf in "DZAI\init" to customize the addon settings (ie: Enable/Disable zombies, AI loadouts, AI spawns, etc.)
- Repack your mission.pbo file.
- You are now ready to start your server.

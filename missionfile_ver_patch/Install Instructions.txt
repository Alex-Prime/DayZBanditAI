Last Updated: 3:21 PM 10/21/2013

About the Mission File Version of DZAI: Use these instructions to convert the DZAI install package for compatibility with your mission pbo if you are unable to edit your dayz_server.pbo

What you need:
----------------------------------------------------
- cpbo (or any other PBO packing program). cpbo can be downloaded as part of the Arma Tools package at http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=411.
- A text editor (Notepad++ is recommended).
- Access to your mission .pbo.
- A downloaded copy of DZAI

Basic Installation Guide:
----------------------------------------------------

1. Unpack your mission pbo. If using cpbo, right click the .pbo file and click "Extract".
2. Copy the downloaded DZAI folder from the *root directory* of the download package inside your unpacked mission folder. In this folder, you should also see init.sqf, mission.sqm, description.ext.
3. Copy the DZAI folder from the *missionfile_ver_patch* directory of the download package inside your unpacked mission folder. Replace all files when prompted.
4. Edit your mission init.sqf with a text editor.
5. Add this line at the end of your init.sqf:

	if (isServer) then {call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "DZAI\dzai_initserver_mf_ver.sqf";};

6. Optionally, you may edit DZAI's settings in DZAI\init\dzai_config.sqf

7. Repack your mission pbo by right-clicking the unpacked folder, then click on "create PBO". If prompted to overwrite, click "Yes".

Note: You may store your custom settings changes in DZAI\DZAI_settings_override.sqf. This file is a convenient way to store and transfer your custom settings when upgrading to a newer version of DZAI. Further instructions are provided inside this file.

Last Updated: 6:36 PM 10/6/2013

What you need:
----------------------------------------------------
- cpbo (or any other PBO packing program). cpbo can be downloaded as part of the Arma Tools package at http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=411.
- A text editor (Notepad++ is recommended).
- Access to your dayz_server.pbo.
- A downloaded copy of DZAI

Basic Installation Guide:
----------------------------------------------------

1. Unpack your dayz_server.pbo. If using cpbo, right click dayz_server.pbo and click "Extract".
2. Copy the downloaded DZAI folder inside your unpacked dayz_server folder.
3. Edit server_monitor.sqf with a text editor. It is located in \dayz_server\system.
4. Search for the line that says:

		allowConnection = true;

	Change the line to this:

		call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "\z\addons\dayz_server\DZAI\init\dzai_initserver.sqf";
		allowConnection = true;
	
5. Optionally, you may edit DZAI's settings in dayz_server\DZAI\init\dzai_config.sqf

6. Repack your dayz_server.pbo by right-clicking the unpacked folder, then click on "create PBO". If prompted to overwrite, click "Yes".

Troubleshooting: A number of users have reported issues with entering the game after repacking their dayz_server.pbo. 
If you encounter this problem, copy the $PBOPREFIX$ file inside the 'extras' folder and paste it inside the dayz_server folder and then repack it into pbo format. This should fix the connection problems.

Note: You may store your custom settings changes in DZAI\DZAI_settings_override.sqf. This file is a convenient way to store and transfer your custom settings when upgrading to a newer version of DZAI. Further instructions are provided inside this file.
